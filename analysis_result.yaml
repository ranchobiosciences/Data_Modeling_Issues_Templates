    description: 'stash/s3 Filesystem Location(s) including the configured endpoint,
      bucket (aka mount for sftp), and directory paths. This is used to inform permissions
      enforcement on the stash/s3 filesystem, which can only work recursively on the
      directory level. Because of this restriction/behavior of the stash/s3 filesystem,
      this field will also be used to restrict stash/s3 file attachments to the analysis
      result node using ABAC rules: the files must exist with a key  that is within
      or under the defined locations. Otherwise an error will be thrown.
